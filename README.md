## About This Project

The [G20](https://www.g20.org/) consists of 20 of the world's major economies, with its members accounting for "more than 80% of world GDP, 75% of global trade and 60% of the population of the planet." 

For this project, we will be looking at the economic spending of 12 of these members. This project constitutes an investigation into how these 12 countries spend on eduction, healthcare and national defense -- three important indicators that bolster and secure the economic and social well-being of a nation.

### G20 Members for this Project:

Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, United States, United Kingdom.

### Conclusion
Of the 12 countries selected, the spending between United States and China are the most fascinating to juxatpose. As China races to push its stance as a dominating global economic power, having just recently declared the end of [extreme poverty](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-56194622) within its borders, we see in this project how it has spent and changed its spending on healthcare, education, and defense to compete with the United States.
